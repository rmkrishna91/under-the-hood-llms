# ðŸ¦™ LLaMA ChatGPT Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to replicate the behavior of ChatGPT using Metaâ€™s **LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct** model and Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` library.

The notebook walks through:
- Setting up the text generation pipeline
- Formatting system-user prompts using a chat template
- Tokenizing input for LLaMA models
- Generating outputs and decoding responses
- Exploring model internals (weights, tokenizer config, generation settings)

ðŸ“Œ **Use Case**: Educational walkthrough for understanding how LLMs like ChatGPT process instructions behind the scenes.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- Hugging Face account & access token (for loading LLaMA)

## ðŸš€ Model Used
- `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`

## ðŸ“· Screenshots
Includes annotated outputs, model structure, and Hugging Face model directory explanations.
